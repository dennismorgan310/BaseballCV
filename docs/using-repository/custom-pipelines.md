# Building Custom Analysis Pipelines

BaseballCV's true power emerges when we combine its various components into comprehensive analysis pipelines. Let's explore how to create a custom pipeline that focuses on ball tracking and game context analysis, two fundamental aspects of baseball analysis.

## Understanding Pipeline Components

A baseball analysis pipeline typically involves several key steps working in harmony:

1. Data Acquisition: Preparing and loading video footage
2. Frame Analysis: Processing individual frames for specific elements
3. Sequential Analysis: Understanding how elements change over time
4. Context Integration: Adding game situation understanding
5. Results Compilation: Organizing findings into useful formats

Let's build a complete pipeline that demonstrates these concepts:

```python
from baseballcv.functions import LoadTools
from baseballcv.datasets import DatasetProcessor
from baseballcv.models import Florence2
import cv2
import numpy as np

class BaseballAnalysisPipeline:
    """

    and game context understanding

```

Let's break down why this pipeline is effective:

### Robust Data Handling

The pipeline includes several features that make it reliable and robust:
- Retry logic for model loading
- Confidence thresholds for detections
- Interpolation for missing data points
- Proper error handling throughout

### Efficient Processing

We've organized the processing to minimize computational overhead:
- Context analysis runs only once per sequence
- Frame processing focuses only on essential elements
- Data structures are optimized for quick access

### Clear Data Organization

The pipeline maintains well-structured data throughout:
- Each frame's results are consistently formatted
- Temporal relationships are preserved
- Results are easy to analyze further

### Quality Control

Several quality control measures are built in:
- Confidence thresholds filter out weak detections
- Missing data is handled gracefully
- Processing steps are logged for monitoring

This pipeline structure provides a foundation for baseball video analysis that you can extend based on your specific needs. Whether you're analyzing pitches, tracking game situations, or building a complete game analysis system, these principles of organization and robustness will serve you well.
